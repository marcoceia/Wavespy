This software was developed for the analysis of ultrasonic data obtained using Picoscope equipment. It was written in Python aiming to an easy implementation of new methodologies for such data analysis. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed using Tkinter provides interactivity and allows an easy and quick learning of the procedures.
